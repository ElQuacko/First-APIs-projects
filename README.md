# First-APIs-projects
This is my first API project. Don't how it will turn out so I'll describe it in detail a little bit later.

hackerNewsAPI.py is a project from E.Matthes book "Python Crash Course", I'm not the original author it was only for training purposes.


currenciesRatesAPI.py is a simple project which task is to connect with a given website and get necessary information about
currency exchange rates. Feel free to leave a comment, I'd love to get some feedback from you. Have a nice day!
