# First-APIs-projects

Hello guys!
Some time ago I've decided to start my coding journey. I've been doing "Hello world" in uncountable number of languages but after learning syntax I usually didn't know what to do and then I've quited. That was the story with C/C++, js and previously also Python. But I've decided this time I'll do one step more, do some solid research and finally learn how to code.

So here you have my first ever GitHub uploaded code which I've decided to show to world.

currenciesRatesAPI.py is a simple program designed to connect with web API and get currency exchange rates. Feel free to leave a comment, I'd love to get some feedback from you and any tip which would allow me to improve my coding skills. 

Have a nice day!
